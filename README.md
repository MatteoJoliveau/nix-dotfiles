## Structure

## Contributing

This repo is (unsurprisingly) managed with [Nix Shells].

It requires having `nix-shell` and `direnv` installed and available, in which case it should configure everything 
automatically when entering the root dir from a shell prompt.

### Formatting

`*.nix` source files are formatted using [`nixpkgs-fmt`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-fmt).
