# Dungeondraft

Dungeondraft is an intuitive yet powerful dungeon map creation tool for 64-bit Windows 10, Linux, and MacOSX.

It is paid software and can be purchased on the [official website](https://dungeondraft.net/#Purchase) for dirt cheap.

This Nix derivation does not include the program files, they must be downloaded separately and extracted here. At least three files are needeed:

- `Dungeondraft.x86_64` the main binary executable
- `Dungeondraft.pck` the core data file
- `Dungeondraft.png` the official icon (used for the desktop entry)
